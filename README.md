# Mi. Lia. - Cloud Eng.

# Who

- A [maths](https://www.math.upatras.gr/en/) (MSc) and [physics](https://www.physics.uoc.gr/en) (BSc) graduate. My MSc thesis was an emperic study on Active Machine learning (AML), using JCLAL library and python3.

- I started out in the data field working as a python backend & ML engineer at a bioinformatics startup for about 1.5 years. Later, I've worked 3.5 years as a GCP Data Engineer and Apigee Solutions Engineer at Webhelp ES, and for some months as a DevOps Cloud Engineer at Schwarz IT Barcelona with technologies such as Kubernetes, Virtualization, golang and python. Currently I'm in the lookout for new opportunities in the Data Engineering field at a company with great culture.

- Inspired by Archimedes (Αρχιμήδης). Engineer by day but a mathematician at heart. Mathematics teach one how to pose the right questions. And this is a great skill for any engineer.
