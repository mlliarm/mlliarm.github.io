# Mi. Lia. - Data Eng.

# Who

- A [maths](https://www.math.upatras.gr/en/) (MSc) and [physics](https://www.physics.uoc.gr/en) (BSc) graduate. My MSc thesis was an emperic study on Active Machine learning (AML), using JCLAL library and python3.

- I think that modern ML is just glorified stastistics applied on modern computer hardware.

- The theory ([eg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension), [eg'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning), [eg''](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory)) although it's pretty nice, nobody seems to give a damn about it nowadays.

- After working 2.5 years as a GCP Data Engineer at Webhelp ES, now I'm working as an Apigee Solutions Engineer in the same company. I think every Data Engineer should know how to create an API (REST, gRPC) for their backend data infrastructure.

- If I'd have to name one of my greatest influences it'd be Archimedes (Αρχιμήδης).
